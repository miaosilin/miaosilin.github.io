# Public Sector Personnel Economics

### Abstract

Wages and promotion standards can partially offset a fundamental contracting problem: **the inability of public sector workers to contract on performance, and the inability of political masters to contract on forbearance from meddling**.

Despite the **dual contracting problem**, properly constructed personnel policies can encourage intrinsically motivated public sector employees to invest in expertise, seek promotion, remain in the public sector, and develop policy projects. However, doing so **requires internal personnel policies that sort "slackers" from "zealots."** Finally, even with well-designed personnel policies, there remains an **inescapable trade-off between political control and expertise acquisition**.

### Introduction

The bases of the two contracting problems in public agencies.

​		First, performance contracting in public agencies is frequently problematic.

​		Second, political meddling in public agencies is pervasive and unavoidable.
