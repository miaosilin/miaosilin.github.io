# Moral Hazard_Single Task

Moral hazard: hidden action

## 2.1.1 Standard model: symmetric information

$P$: principal;    $A$: agent;    $x_i$: production of agent $i$;    $a\in A$: effort of agent $A$;    $c(a)$ is convex; $c'>0, $ $ c''\le0$ ;

all utilities are VNM formula;     $\underline U$ is $A$'s preserved utility



$P$'s object function: $ V(x,w)=v(x-w)$                          $v'>0,  v''\le0$  concave

$A$'s object function: $U(w,a) = u(w)-c(a)$                     $u'>0,u''\le0$ concave



 $P$'s mathematic program: 
$$
\begin{align}
\max \limits_{\{a,w(x_i)\}}\sum_{i=1}^np_i(a)v(x_i-w(x_i)) \\
s.t. \sum_{i=1}^np_i(a)u(w(x_i))-c(a)\ge\underline U 
\end{align}
$$
According to concave program's rule 
$$
\lambda = \frac{v'(x_i-w^{FB}(x_i))}{u'(w^{FB}(x_i))}, i\in \{1,2,...,n\}
$$


$r_P$ and $r_A$ is  $P$'s and $A$'s Arrow-Pratt meassure of absolute risk aversion respectively, The bigger r is, the more risk averse principal/agent is 
$$
\frac{dw^{FB}}{dx_i}=\frac{r_P}{r_P+r_A}
$$

		1. $r_P=0,r_A>>0,\frac{dw}{dx}=0$, fixed wage
  		2. $r_A=0,\frac{dw}{dx}=1$, A get all marginal production
  		3. The bigger $r_A$ is ,the bigger proportion of fixed wage is.

### Proposition : 

​		if P is risk neutral and A is risk averse, P should offer A constant wage provide full insurance;

​		if A is risk neutral and P is risk averse, P should sell his firm to A at a certain price;

​		if both P and A are risk neutral, P should sell his firm to A;

​		if both P and A are risk averse, they  share risk according to a certain proportion.
