***In your country? Do any numbers have Special meaning.\***

The country members had special meanings. For example, the number eight, **which pronunciation** is similar to the to the world, **which means** make a fortune in Chinese. So it's a lucky number in Chinese culture. And **by comparison**, the number four pronunciation is similar to the world death in the Chinese in Chinese. So so it's not very.

 

Yes, there are many numbers have have **special meaning** in China, such as eight and four. So it has the similar **pronunciation** with the meaning of the money. So more a businessman would like to choose that number. We to use the telephone number. But the number four, it's the stance of the death. So people usually avoided.

 

***How do numbers help your life?\***

Yes, **numbers means a lot to me**, especially for me, because my I work as an accountant. I have to deal with numbers every day. Should be sensitive with numbers as well. Number is part of my life and work. So if I'm good at numbers, it is much easier for me to be a good accountant. Otherwise I will make a mistake in my job.

 

 

 

***How do you remember the number?\***

Association helped a lot, I guess. For example, if I need to memorize my past, excuse me, my friends birthday, I will compare it with my mother's birthday. Also. Sometimes I divide the numbers into several small groups so that it's easier for me to memorize. For example, I usually divide the telephone numbers into three groups. Um, I find it easier and quicker for me to memorize in that way.

 

But most of the country repairing. I need to reserve all my brain. And you, right? Sports or a copy of mine careful. Uh, after, but still has I can remember easily.

 

 

 

 

***Describe a person who taught you something important. You should say who the person is, where you meet him or her. What you the person talk to you and explain how you feel about what he or she taught you.\***

 

. And I remember one time when it was **raining very heavily** and one of my classmates forgot to bring an umbrella. So he landed his umbrella to that boy and said that he could ride his bike home so he can arrive home in the short term in a shorter time. So it doesn't matter. And it really **left me a very deep impression** that he did that. And I think he really showed me how important it is to be warm hearted and helpful to others. And in that way you can make real good friends. However, I don't think he actually told me that he actually influenced me by his own behaviors and ways of dealing with other people. I think it is really influential. And it connect me at a very big influence for my whole life.

 

 

I'd like to describe a woman two or three years ago, I met her at dinner. Um, at the time she was she was the boss of a media company. Uh, when she was graduated, she was simultaneous interpretation. But she was in poor health. So she had to quit her job. But she never lost her face. So she started a media company with her husband in the next few years. They succeeded in the end. I think I think her story the story tell me that. Hard, hard work is essential requirements for success. No one is born successful. So you have to find your advantages and strengthen your strong points. Um, and story also reminds me that **all roads lead to Rome,** which means, um, if you are if you are filled in the first time, don't be upset and don't lose your faith. Just keep going. You can me to success in the end.

 

I would like to talk about one of my classmates. He we've known each other for six years since we were in our middle high school, which as long as we have been classmates, he might have no idea what he has been teaching me because I never told him about it. Circumstance. I still remember there was a time when he was in a low mood, he always attached great attention to his grades. I don't know why he did a better job during that time. Then the people of class based on our headmaster began to make comments on him. Asked once if the commons and the situation made me too. He also said the only thing he could do was kept was keeping doing things then. Having confidence in himself. That's great. He has realized his dream of becoming an engineer. I feel so lucky to have a classmate who I am. If someone ask me to the person who has made a difference.

 

 

**When it comes to a person who taught me something important. There is no doubt.** It was it is my uh, violin teacher, MR. June, the first time I met him was that my friend introduced me to um. Violin. So my parents brought me to the MR. Jones house. I met him uh, in my impression. It was a. In the past, I was a killer. So playing the violin was obviously a difficult mission. What's more? I was a timid girl, so uh, when thinking of playing the violin on the stage, it's always translated me a lot. But one day MR. Zhu told me that, don't be afraid. **Practice practice makes perfect.** Just make progress day by day. Uh, for example, I can practice playing the violin after school every day for one hour. I can finally reach Michael Hayes would help me a lot. Following his words, I became more and more confidence. And I said play in. Successfully Richard Michael, and play the violin stage. So I feel very grateful to mine. Violin teacher MR. Zhu.
