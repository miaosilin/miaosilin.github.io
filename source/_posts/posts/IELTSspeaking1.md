***Do you like running?***



Because you know um how long you can. But also we can um relax ourselves after a hard work.So.I usually go out for running. For school. People are always always keep sleep so running.It's also best way to stage.

 

Well, **frankly speaking,** I don't like running very much because um I live in shenzhen. It is like the tropical city. So um, the weather is always so hot. And when you run for 20 minutes or even less, you look at sweaty and exhausted in a very short time. And I really don't like that kind of thing. So if I can make the choice to use um. Or um, lifting dumbbells. I think that um, these types of exercising are more suitable for me and like my cup of tea.

 

Actually, I don't think I like running. I'm a lazy girl. Like to stay at home. I like to watch TV. Like two is nice, but I don't like exercising. Running and other. Leads to action. That I don't think so. Dog to watch TV.

 

**What places are suitable for running near your place?** 

 

I suppose the proper place for running people is the gym where there are a lot of professional equipments, like the running machines. And you know some professional coaches who would Guide you. Just do it for Free. You know, um. The way in running. And the second reason is that people don't have to just expose themselves to the sunlight for extended period of time and against. Imagine you're running outdoors. And if you know. The sun is just uh watching you. And I think you don't feel comfortable while running. So that is why I I think my dream is perfect place.

 

Well, I know many people would prefer to run in gyms. And that's kind of reasonable. Because if you run on the road, you can smell in many car emissions, which is kind of bad for your health. But I kind of like one of the lakes near my school called angelic. It is isolated from the downtown and skyscrapers is very natural. It has many trees and a very big lake, though it's isolated, is also well equipped with many street lights and a road forum stroke. As so many people still go there for like a walk after dinner or for exercising purpose.

 

Are referring to this question. I would say I always run in a park which is near my apartment. And I believe it is a suitable place for running. First of all, uh, there is a white run runway uh, in the park, and cars and bikes are forbidden there. And secondly, ah, there are a lot of plants like trees and flowers. Um, so the great environment and you know that um, air clean air uh will provide people a positive mood to do any exercise.

 

**Do you like watching running races on TV?**

 

Well, it really depends on what kind of race you refer to. Um. If you mean the longer distance races like marathons, I really think it is very boring because you just see those people running and running like a thousand years until they finally finished their running. It's kind of boring for us audience. But for some short distance races, especially those with hurdles like 110 meters race. It starts and finished in a very short period of time. So you don't need much patience to um, keep yourself focused into the race. And also it got a really good atmosphere with all the audience were shouting for their favorite runners. It is very excited and I really love it.

 

No, but it depends on what kind of races it is. If it's a short distance race, I would like to watch it for throwing. It's less than three seconds to decide whether the effort to address the payoff is worthwhile or not. If it's a long distance, however, like uh, 2000 meters. I would prefer spending my time on something else and believe that taking too much time on give me a any pressure from it.

 

Well, sometimes I will write them. I want this because I just like to take no wrong in your name, you cannot just watch others. What I want still on track to uh. Uh, I will be. Thank you much.

 

**When was the last time you ran for a long distance?**

 

Well, since I'm not pretty much a person fond of running, I only run when I have to do it. So I think the last time I run a long distance would be back into the time when I was in Junior high school. So at that time, everyone of us should take a running test. If we want to go to a high senior high school. So on every day in the p e class, our teacher wants us to run around 800 or a thousand meters. I forget um, to improve our writing skills. But unfortunately after three years of exercising and training, I didn't find myself very much improvements in the final running test. So I don't think I really got ta.

 

It was about last Sunday. I ran for long distance because when Monday to Friday, I need to fully concentrated on learning or working. I didn't have enough time to run for long distance or a long time. So only on Saturday or Friday, I would spare one hour to run to keep my feet and relieve stress.

 

Um, it's my 800 million yearly test. The first time I finished my running test within four minutes. So it's a great accomplishment for me, especially after so many nights ahead spent on improving my writing skills. The most impressive thing that we all put up orange jackets with electric bars in the pocket. So that just didn't have to look at the clock when we ran over the line. Then we have then we had our friends.

 

**Do students run a school in your country?**

 

Well, yes, students run, but I think most of the time they only run when it is compulsory. Like when I was in Junior high school, every one of us should pass a running test to get you a good senior high school. And after we go into college, since the government pay much attention to the students' health, every college student should pass a running test if they want to graduate. So children. So students are forced to run because of these rules. But um, actually I think not many of us would choose to run if uh, if they are not forced to do so.

 

Yeah, definitely students went to school in my country. Um. First of all, you know study is a hard and stressful thing, especially in high school. So students need to do something to relax themselves. Uh, and secondly, running can also help students to keep healthy. And also, you know like stay in shape. So as soon as the class is over, there always will be a lot of students running on the playground.

 

Um, yes, especially after the national education bureau made the announcement that if we fail our running test, we won't be able to graduate successfully, which means we have to wait till the next year to graduate for an hour on a test. It has driven more students to go to a gym and the playground. But the glow of the multiverse is just passing through it not for higher grades, which is a pity, but compared to the previous situation. That has been better.

 

**Describe something special you took home From a tourist attraction.**

**You should say what it was when you bought it. What it was like and explain why you think it was special.**

 

As for a special thing, I took home from a tourist attraction. It reminds me a little special memories of me while I was travelling in hong kong. And it was the first time i've been standing in front of a suicide, uh, because I am a girl who lives in England in my 20 years life. So I haven't seen anything before. And while I was uh walking along the beach, suddenly I saw something sparkling under the sun shine in on the beach. So I pick it up and check and check out what it is. And I found that they're actually a some little beautiful shows and they have a variety of color with their shining under the under the lights. So it really shocked me because I have never seen that before seen before. So I started to collect little beautiful shells in my pocket and after collection after the collection on the beach and also bought many souvenirs made by shells and pearls. And after I came back home, I give it all to many, many friends of me. And they are all so shocked by the beauty of nature. So so because it is like the first time i've seen uh, seeing the product product, a beautiful product of the sea. So it was really special for me.

 

Uh, I still remember two months ago when I was in a very, very high mountain and sichuan province, I went there for traveling and I picked a very tiny stone just about the size. And the color is very beautiful. There are three kinds of color. They merged together pink, green, and blue. And I took the special store with me. And I now when every time I see it, I can remember those moment when I climbed meant. It's obviously Free. That I think is much more precious than some other souvenirs I bought from tourist attractions. You know the the the Top of the mountain is about 490 meters above sea level. So it's very high. And it's really a struggle for me to get myself into that, Kate, and and I almost said I cannot fly end, I need to take a rest every day. 12 or 15 metres. So quite a hard journey. Great concert to climate to conquer it. And I feel very proud of myself. And so this tiny stone is very means a lot of people.

 

Well, I'm going to describe our likeness, which I took home from a tourist attraction. Um, you know, if memory serves, it was my 17 years old and my summer vacation on Monday, one of my best friends, he told me that black girls and saving my own sorry, I don't know what his English is just a historical building in China. Then we decided to go there to see the mail. And you know when they arrive at the destination, it was amazing. We were all shocked by its beauty. Um, you know this experience broaden my horizon and open my mind. You know, when we came back, I bought a necklace which was made of Amber. I bought this gift for my brother. It was a very warm hearted person. He also gave me some advice when I'm in trouble. And he also control maps and I fell down in the dumps. So I really wanted to buy a gift for him. So I bought this one. When my brother received this gift. He was very happy. Um, he like this gift very much.
