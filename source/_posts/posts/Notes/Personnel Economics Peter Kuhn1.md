# **Evidence on Employee Motivation**



**Reciprocity:**（互惠）



Bruhin, Adrian, Ernst Fehr, and Daniel Schunk. “[The Many Faces of Human Sociality: Uncovering the Distribution and Stability of Social Preferences](https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvy018)” *Journal of the European Economic Association*, Volume 17, Issue 4, August 2019, Pages 1025–1069.  



A detailed experimental study of Swiss university students shows that other-regarding preferences are the rule, not the exception. Three broad types of individuals are identified, all of whom value others’ payoffs more when they are ahead than when they are behind others. “Strong altruists” are moderately reciprocal and put positive value on others even when behind. “Moderate altruists” display no reciprocity and place positive, but less weight on others’ payoffs. “Behindness –averse” types put a large negative weight on others’ payoffs when behind and are selfish otherwise.  The purely selfish model of “rational economic man” does not emerge as a useful model of behavior for any group of subjects. 一项针对瑞士大学生的详细实验研究表明，**“他人偏好”是普遍规律，而非例外**。人们将个人分为三大类，**领先的人比落后的人更关心他人的收入**。强大的利他主义者是适度互惠的，即使在别人落后的时候也会给予别人积极的价值。适度的利他主义者不表现出互惠性，而且倾向于积极，但对他人的回报不那么重视。反对落后的人在落后的时候会给他人带来很大的负面影响，否则他们会很自私。纯粹自私的理性经济人模型并不能成为任何主体群体的有用行为模型。





**Loss Aversion:**



Bulte, Erwin, John A. List, and Daan Van Soest. 2019 [Toward an Understanding of the Welfare Effects of Nudges: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Uganda](http://papers.nber.org/papers/W26286?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg22) NBER working paper no. 26286



Conducts a field experiment in Uganda that compares output levels across 1000 workers over similar tasks and incentives, framed as either losses or gains.  The authors find that loss aversion can be leveraged to increase the productivity of labor.  The estimated welfare costs of using the loss contract are quite modest, perhaps because workers view it as a (soft) commitment device. 在乌干达进行了一项实地实验，比较了1000名工人在类似任务和激励下的产出水平。作者发现，**厌恶损失可以用来提高劳动生产率。使用损失合同的估计福利成本相当轻，或许是因为工人们将其视为一种(软)承诺手段。**





**Fairness Between Workers:**



Almås, Ingvild & Cappelen, Alexander & Tungodden, Bertil. (2019). “[Cutthroat Capitalism versus Cuddly Socialism: Are Americans MoreMeritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking than Scandinavians?](https://doi.org/10.1086/705551)” *Journal of Political Economy*, forthcoming. 



Spectators in the US and Norway had the opportunity to redistribute pay from high- to low-paid workers (on MTurk) when (a) the pay gap was randomly assigned, versus (b) the pay gap was due to a productivity difference. When the pay gap was due to luck, 80% of Norwegians chose to completely eliminate it; only 50% of Americans did this. When the pay gap was due to performance, 35% of Norwegians still chose to redistribute completely; only 10% of Americans did this. Thus, national culture seems to affect peoples’ perceptions of fairness in compensation: Americans are much less egalitarian, and much less averse to rewarding luck than Norwegians.  In a project called “Fairness Across the World” The authors are extending this study to 60 countries, with 65,000 spectator workers.

在MTurk网站上，美国和挪威的观众有机会将收入从高收入工人重新分配给低收入工人，原因是:(a)收入差距是随机分配的，(b)收入差距是由于生产率差异造成的。当收入差距是运气造成的时候，**80%的挪威人选择完全消除它;只有50%的美国人这样做。**当收入差距是由工作表现造成的时候，35%的挪威人仍然选择完全重新分配;只有10%的美国人这样做。因此，**民族文化似乎影响了人们对薪酬公平的看法:美国人不像挪威人那么平等，也不像挪威人那么讨厌奖励运气。**在一个名为“世界公平”的项目中，作者将这项研究扩展到60个国家，有65000名观众工作人员。



# **Selection**

 

**For "Choosing Qualifications"-- An example of negative productivity interactions between workers**:



Miller, Conrad, Jennifer Peck, and Mehmet Seek. “[Integration Costs and Missing Women in Firms](https://econ.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/missing_women_aug2019.pdf)” unpublished paper, UC Berkeley. August 2019



In Saudi Arabia and some other countries it is costly for a firm to employ both men and women because social norms prohibit interaction between unrelated men and women. (Employing both genders in the same location requires configuring the workspace to segregate the genders.) In this environment, only large firms will employ both genders, and many smaller firms will tend to be male-only. Social norms against between-group interaction like these are examples of (a) “antagonistic inputs” in the production process (Section 12.2) and (b) employee-based taste discrimination (Section 16.2). 

在沙特阿拉伯和其他一些国家，公司同时雇用男性和女性的成本很高，因为社会规范禁止不相关的男性和女性交往。(在同一位置使用这两个性别需要配置工作区来隔离性别。)在这种环境下，**只有大公司会雇佣男女员工，而许多小公司往往只雇用男性员工**。这些反对群体间互动的社会规范是(a)生产过程中的对抗性输入和(b)基于员工的味觉歧视的例子。



**Referrals:**



Barr, Tavis, Raicho Bojilov and Lalith Munasinghe, "[Referrals and Search Efficiency: Who Learns What and When?](https://doi.org/10.1086/703163)," *Journal of Labor Economics* 37, no. 4 (October 2019): 1267-1300.

 

Using data from a call center, the authors show that referrals help employers attract applicants of superior performance.  However, performance differences between referred and nonreferred workers diminish with tenure through selective turnover (less-productive workers are less likely to stay with the firm). Thus, the main advantage of referred applicants is that they have been pre-screened for performance-relevant characteristics before they start work. 

使用来自一个呼叫中心的数据，作者表明，**推荐有助于雇主吸引优秀的申请者。然而，通过选择性离职，引荐员工和非引荐员工之间的绩效差异会随着任期的延长而缩小(低生产力的员工不太可能留在公司)。因此，被推荐的申请人的主要优势是，他们在开始工作之前已经被预先筛选了与表现相关的特征。**

 

**Promotions from within:**



Benson, Alan Danielle Li, and Kelly Shue. “[Promotions and the Peter Principle](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz022)” *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*, Volume 134, Issue 4, November 2019, Pages 2085–2134. 



The best worker is not always the best candidate for manager. In these cases, do firms promote the best potential manager or the best worker in their current job?  Using microdata on the performance of sales workers at 131 firms, the authors find evidence consistent with the Peter Principle, which proposes that firms prioritize current job performance in promotion decisions at the expense of indicators of managerial potential.  The authors estimate that this practice is quite costly to firms, and conclude that either (a) firms are making inefficient promotion decisions or (b) firms place a high priority on using promotions to as a financial reward for good work performance. 最好的员工并不总是经理的最佳人选。在这些情况下，公司会提拔目前工作中最优秀的潜在经理还是最优秀的员工?通过对131家公司销售人员表现的微观数据进行分析，作者发现了与彼得原则一致的证据。该原则提出，公司在做出晋升决定时，优先考虑当前的工作表现，而不是管理潜力指标。作者估计这种做法对公司来说代价很高，并得出结论:(a)公司的晋升决策效率低下，或者(b)公司高度重视将晋升作为对良好工作表现的经济奖励。

 

Barfort, Sebastian, Nikolaj A. Harmon, Frederik Hjorth, and Asmus Leth Olsen. 2019. "Sustaining Honesty in Public Service: The Role of Selection." *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*, 11 (4): 96-123.



Which types of workers self-select into work environments where financial performance incentives are weak? In countries like Denmark where corruption is low, people who are more honest are much more likely to self-select into public sector jobs. In Denmark, dishonest individuals care more about money and self-select out of public service into higher-paying private sector jobs.  This pattern differs sharply from existing findings from more corrupt settings. In Denmark, it suggests that raising public sector wages could actually backfire—by attracting more dishonest candidates into public service. 在财务绩效激励机制薄弱的工作环境中，哪些类型的员工会自我选择?在像丹麦这样腐败程度较低的国家，更诚实的人更有可能选择进入公共部门工作。在丹麦，不诚实的人更关心钱，他们自己选择离开公共部门，进入薪水更高的私营部门工作。此模式与现有的损坏设置的结果有很大不同。**在丹麦，该研究表明，提高公共部门的工资实际上可能适得其反，因为这会吸引更多不诚实的候选人进入公共服务部门。**

 

 

**Discrimination**



Ajunwa, Ifeoma. “[Beware of Automated Hiring](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/opinion/ai-hiring-discrimination.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)” *New York Times*, October 8. 2019. 



The author discusses a number of pitfalls associated with It algorithmically-based hiring, and argue that it could accentuate, rather than eliminate discrimination in the hiring process. 作者讨论了一些与基于It算法的招聘相关的陷阱，并认为它**会加重而不是消除招聘过程中的歧视**。

 

Kessler, Judd B.,   Corinne Low and Colin D. Sullivan “[Incentivized Resume Rating: Eliciting Employer   Preferences without Deception](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20181714)” *American Economic Review*  2019, 109(11): 3713–3744   

Like resume audit studies, incentivized resume  rating (IRR) is an experimental method for studying how employers choose  successful candidates from a pool of applicants. In this new approach,  experienced recruiters evaluate resumes they know are hypothetical;  recruiters are motivated to do this honestly and carefully because their ratings  will influence which *real* resumes  they will eventually receive. Key  benefits of IRR, relative to audit studies, are that (a) they do not require  deception of employers, and (b) they can elicit employers’ beliefs that the  applicant will accept the offer, which is a confounding factor in audit  studies.  

和简历审计研究一样，激励简历评级(IRR)是一种实验方法，用于研究雇主如何从众多申请者中选择成功的候选人。在这种新方法中，有经验的招聘人员会评估他们知道是假设的简历;招聘人员这么做是出于诚实和谨慎的动机，因为他们的评级会影响他们最终收到哪份真正的简历。相对于审计研究而言，内部审计的主要好处是(a)它们不需要欺骗雇主，(b)它们可以诱使雇主相信申请人会接受录用，这是审计研究中的一个混淆因素。

 

# **Tournaments**

 

**Career ladders inside firms** 



Frederiksen, Anders, Lisa Blau Kahn, and Fabian Lange, "[Supervisors and Performance Management Systems](https://doi.org/10.1086/705715)," forthcoming, *Journal of Political Economy* 



The authors show that supervisors vary widely in the performance ratings they assign to subordinates of similar quality, and that these supervisor ratings differences impact their subordinates’ subsequent careers. Supervisors’ average ratings differ for two reasons: a) some supervisors are more lenient than others; and (b) some supervisors are better managers than others. The authors’ estimate that firms are only partially aware of these differences in their managers’ rating practices. 两位作者指出，**上司对质量相似的下属的评价差别很大，而这些上司的评价差异会影响其下属以后的职业生涯。**监管者的平均评分不同有两个原因:一是一些监管者比另一些监管者更宽容;(b)有些主管比其他人更擅长管理。两位作者估计，企业在管理人员评级实践中只部分意识到这些差异。

 

**Gender and competition**



Alan, Sule and Seda Ertac. [Mitigating the Gender Gap in the Willingness to Compete: Evidence From a Randomized Field Experiment](https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvy036). *Journal of the European Economic Association*, Volume 17, Issue 4, August 2019, Pages 1147–1185. 



Using a randomized experiment, the authors demonstrate that an educational intervention in primary schools can eliminate the gender gap in the willingness to compete. The authors’ intervention aims to foster grit, a skill that is highly predictive of achievement.  The intervention promotes grit by exposing children to a worldview that emphasizes the role of effort in achievement and that encourages perseverance. 通过随机实验，作者论证了**小学教育干预可以消除性别在竞争意愿上的差异**。作者的干预旨在培养毅力，这是一种高度预测成就的技能。通过让孩子们接触一种世界观，这种世界观强调努力在成就中所起的作用，并鼓励他们坚持不懈，从而促进他们的勇气。

# **Teams**

 

**Leadership:**



Kosfeld, Michael, forthcoming “[TheRole of Leaders in Inducing and Maintaining Cooperation: The CC Strategy](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/12540/the-role-of-leaders-in-inducing-and-maintaining-cooperation-the-cc-strategy)” *The Leadership Quarterly*. 



This paper summarizes recent findings from behavioral economics experiments in the lab and in the field on the role of leaders in human cooperation.  According to the author, successful leaders need to do three things.  First, they need to *trust* workers, in order not demotivate the motivated.  Second, leaders need to *punish*, in order to motivate the non-motivated.  Finally, leaders need to *attract* (and retain) motivated workers for their team. 

 根据作者的观点，成功的领导者需要做三件事。**首先，他们需要“信任”员工，这样才不会挫伤积极性。第二，领导者需要“惩罚”，以激励那些不受激励的人。最后，领导者需要为他们的团队“吸引”(并留住)有积极性的员工**。



**The volunteer’s dilemma:** 



Natanson, Hanna. “[Forget what you may have been told. New study says strangers step in to help 90 percent of the time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/09/06/high-level-help-was-surprising-new-study-says-strangers-step-help-percent-time/)” *The Washington Post, September 6, 2019*



A recent [psychological study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-30180-001?doi=1) of surveillance camera footage from three countries shows that bystanders in actual public conflict aren’t apathetic after all. In 90 percent of these situations, strangers intervened to help victims.  
 最近一项针对三个国家监控录像的心理学研究表明，在实际的公共冲突中，旁观者并非无动于衷。在这些情况中，**有90%是陌生人介入帮助受害者**

 

**Selection into Teams:**



Cooper, David J., Krista Saral, and Marie Claire Villeval “[Why Join a Team?](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/12587/why-join-a-team)” IZA discussion paper no. 12587, September 2019. 

 The authors use lab experiments to study why high ability workers join revenue-sharing teams with less- able co-workers.  Is it because high-ability workers want to help their co-workers financially, or because they expect to realize some long-term financial gains from teaching their teammates?  When team members can communicate, the authors find that high ability workers’ decisions to join teams are driven by expected future financial gains from teaching, and not by their ‘pro-social’ preferences.  There are two main take-aways for managers: First, team-based pay causes strong adverse selection: talented workers tend to avoid team-based pay. Second, adverse selection into teams decreases when high ability workers can reap the gains of mutual learning, which can be facilitated by work environments allow for stable team membership and foster teaching within teams.

两位作者通过实验室实验研究了能力强的员工为什么会加入与能力较差的同事组成的收入共享团队。是因为能力强的员工想要在经济上帮助同事，还是因为他们希望通过教导队友来实现一些长期的经济利益?当团队成员能够交流时，**作者发现高能力员工加入团队的决定是由教学对未来经济收益的预期驱动的，而不是他们的社会偏好。**

**首先，以团队为基础的薪酬会导致强烈的逆向选择:有才华的员工往往会避免以团队为基础的薪酬。第二，当高能力的员工能够收获相互学习的好处时，团队的逆向选择就会减少，而工作环境可以促进团队成员的稳定，并促进团队内部的教学。**
