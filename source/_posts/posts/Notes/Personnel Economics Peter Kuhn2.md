# The Principal-Agent Problem

 

**Multi-tasking:** 

**Athey, Susan, Kevin Bryan and Joshua Gans. “[Designing Organizations and Incentives with Human and Artificial Intelligence Agents](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/1670?)”, paper presented at American Economic Association meetings, January 2020**.  

Building on Aghion-Tirole’s (1997) multi-task agency model, Athey et al. study principals who can use both human agents and algorithms to perform tasks. The authors study when the human or the AI should make the final decision, how incentives and tasks should be designed for both kinds of agents, what types of ‘preferences’ programmers should assign to algorithms. When humans and algorithms work together, it can be optimal to endow algorithms with task preferences that differ from the agent’s. 

 在Aghion-Tirole s(1997)多任务代理模型的基础上，Athey等人研究了能够使用人类代理和算法执行任务的主体。作者研究了人类或人工智能何时应该做出最终决定，激励机制和任务应该如何为这两种代理设计，程序员应该给算法分配什么样的偏好。**当人类和算法一起工作时，赋予算法不同于代理的任务偏好是最优的**。



**Ratchet Effects:** 

**Jeffrey C. Ely and Martin Szydlowski, "[Moving the Goalposts](https://doi.org/10.1086/704387)," \*Journal of Political Economy\* 128, no. 2 (February 2020): 468-506.**

This theory paper considers a situation where –in contrast to the standard ratchet effect model-- the principal but not the worker knows the difficulty of the task. The optimal contract involves “moving the goalposts”:  the principal first gives the agent just enough information to suggest that the task may be  easy. If the task is indeed difficult, the agent is told this only after working long enough to put the difficult task within reach. The agent then completes the difficult task even though he never would have chosen to at the outset.

这篇理论论文考虑了一种情况，与标准的棘轮效应模型相反——**负责人而不是工人知道任务的困难。最理想的合同包括改变目标:委托人首先给代理人足够的信息来表明任务可能很简单。如果任务确实是困难的，则只有在工作足够长的时间，使任务触手可及之后，才会告知代理。然后代理完成了困难的任务，即使他在一开始不会选择这样做。**（孔老师的套路）

 

**Career Concerns:** 

**Ytsma, Erina, and Jana Gallus. “[Recognition and Reputation as Drivers of Open Source Success](https://ideas.repec.org/p/red/sed019/1141.html)”. work in progress, Carnegie Mellon University, 2019.** 

The authors conducted a field experiment on GitHub that varied the publicness of the aggregate feedback (thumbs up or down) that contributors got. The goal is to distinguish the effects of reputation-linked financial incentives (“career concerns”) from non-financial rewards on innovative effort, and how this differs across organizational settings (open source, closed source, inner-source).

作者们在GitHub上进行了一项实地实验，改变贡献者获得的反馈(赞成或反对)的公开程度。目标是区分声誉相关的财务激励(“职业关注”)和对创新努力的非财务奖励的影响，以及这在组织环境(开源、封闭资源、内部资源)中有何不同。

Evidence on Employee Motivation



**Reference Points and Loss Aversion:**

**Pierce, Lamar, Alex Rees-Jones and Charlotte Blank. [The Negative Consequences of Loss-Framed Performance Incentives](https://alexreesjones.github.io/papers/The Negative Consequences of Loss-Framed Performance Incentives.pdf) Unpublished paper, University of Washington, January 2020.** 

The authors randomly introduced loss-framed financial incentives in a nationwide field experiment among 294 car dealers. Dealers randomized into loss-framed (but financially identical) contracts sold 5% *fewer* vehicles than control dealers, generating a revenue loss of $45 million over 4 months.  Interestingly, loss-framing did ‘work’ in the sense that it induced workers to take actions to reduce the chances of incurring a loss. However, this harmed the company because of a multi-tasking problem: dealers switched their efforts away from car models with lower bonuses attached to them.  

在全国范围内对294名汽车经销商进行的实地实验中，作者随机引入了亏损框架的财政激励措施。随机分配到亏损框架(但财务相同)合同的经销商比控制组经销商少销售5%的车辆，在4个月内产生4500万美元的收入损失。有趣的是，“损失框架”确实在某种意义上起作用，即它诱导工人采取行动来减少遭受损失的机会。然而，这对公司造成了损害，**因为它面临一个多任务问题:经销商把精力从奖金较低的车型上转移了。**

 

**Agarwal, Sumit, Ximeng Fang, Lorenz Goette, Tien Foo Sing, Samuel Schoeb, Verena Tiefenbeck, Thorsten Staake, Davin Wang “[The Role of Goals in Motivating Behavior: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment on Resource Conservation](https://www.iame.uni-bonn.de/people/lorenz-goette/goals-and-real-time-feedback)” unpublished paper, University of Bonn, 2017.** 

The authors randomly assigned feedback and goals for water use to consumers taking showers. No financial incentives are used, but users were (randomly) given real-time information on the amount of water used during a shower, and assigned random goals for consumption per shower. Both feedback and goals reduce water consumption substantially. Goals work best when they are neither too easy nor too hard. Other patterns in the data suggest that users get direct utility from satisfying the goal that has been assigned to them. 

 作者随机分配了消费者淋浴用水的反馈和目标。不使用金钱奖励，但用户(随机)得到了淋浴时用水量的实时信息，并随机分配了每次淋浴的用水量。**反馈和目标都大大减少了水的消耗。当目标不太容易也不太困难时，效果最好。数据中的其他模式表明，用户从满足分配给他们的目标中获得直接的效用。**（买一个秤是有利于持续改进的。）



**Wage Fairness among Employees:**

**Hjort, Jonas, Xuan Li and Heather Sarsons. “[Across-Country Wage Compression in Multinationals](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26788)” NBER Working Paper No. 26788, February 2020.** 

Many employers link wages at the firm’s establishments outside of the home region to the level at headquarters.  This is hard to explain without reference to employees’ concerns with horizontal equity. This paper shows that these concerns have real effects: When minimum wage increases in another country cause the company to raise its local wage, the company fires more low-skill workers and hires fewer new workers.  

许多雇主将公司总部以外机构的工资水平与总部的工资水平挂钩。如果不考虑员工对横向公平的关注，这很难解释。本文表明，这些担忧是有实际效果的:当另一个国家的最低工资提高时，公司会提高当地的工资，公司会解雇更多的低技能工人，雇佣更少的新工人。

[Fairness and Frictions: The Impact of Unequal Raises on Quit Behavior](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24906) NBER Working Paper No. 24906, August 2018.**



This paper analyzes how separations responded to arbitrary differences in own and peer wages at a large U.S. retailer. Regression-discontinuity estimates imply large causal effects of peer wages on separations, mostly driven by comparisons with higher-paid peers. 

本文分析了在美国一家大型零售商中，员工离职是如何对自己和同事工资的任意差异做出反应的。回归不连续估计表明，**同事的工资对离职有很大的因果影响，主要是由与收入更高的同事的比较驱动的。**

 

**Income Effects:**

**Boppart, Timo and Per Krusell, "[Labor Supply in the Past, Present, and Future: A Balanced-Growth Perspective](https://doi.org/10.1086/704071)," \*Journal of Political Economy\* 128, no. 1 (January 2020): 118-157.**

Across countries and over a span of 170 years, this paper shows that average hours worked per worker have been falling steadily by a little below 0.5% per year.  It argues that the best explanation of this trend is a negative income effect of real wages on labor supply, which is large enough to more than counterbalance the positive incentive effects of growing real wages. 

这篇论文显示，在170多年的时间里，各个国家的工人平均工作时间一直在稳步下降，每年下降幅度略低于0.5%。本文认为，对这一趋势的最佳解释是实际工资对劳动力供给的负收入效应，这一效应大到足以抵消实际工资增长的正激励效应。



# Selection and Training

 

**Formal vs Informal Recruiting:** 

**Friebel, Guido Matthias Heinz, Mitchell Hoffman, and Nick Zubanov. 2020 [What Do Employee Referral Programs Do? A Firm-level Randomized Controlled Trial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u9fmYSPzRNw2yQLqtexJ9n_I1zonRNZ8/view). NBER Working Paper 25920**

Employee referral programs (ERPs) are randomly introduced in a grocery chain. Overall, ERPs reduce attrition by roughly 15% and reduce labor costs by almost 3%. This is mainly because *all* workers (not just the referred ones) stay longer in treated than control stores, even in stores where no referrals are made. The most promising explanation of these indirect effects is that workers value being involved in hiring.

 员工推荐计划(ERPs)是随机引入的。总的来说，erp减少了大约15%的人员流失率，减少了近3%的劳动力成本。这主要是因为*所有*工人(不仅仅是转诊的工人)在治疗商店呆的时间比对照组商店长，即使在没有转诊的商店也是如此。对于这些间接影响，最有希望的解释是，员工重视参与招聘。



**Avoiding Bias--** **Blind hiring procedures**

**Neumark, David. 2020. [Age Discrimination in Hiring: Evidence from Age-Blind vs. Non-Age-Blind Hiring Procedures](http://papers.nber.org/papers/W26623?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg22)  NBER working paper no. 26623**
 

Hiding older worker’s ages in job applications raises their chances of their getting an interview, but these workers then encounter much lower job offer rates after their interviews (which reveal their age). The author interprets this evidence as strongly consistent with age discrimination.

 在求职申请中**隐瞒年长员工的年龄会提高他们获得面试机会的几率，但这些员工在面试后会得到更低的工作机会**(因为他们的年龄暴露了出来)。作者认为这一证据与年龄歧视有强烈的一致性。



**Monopsony Wage-Setting:**

**Dube, Arindrajit, Jeff Jacobs, Suresh Naidu, and Siddharth Suri. 2020. "[Monopsony in Online Labor Markets](https://www.aeaweb.org/atypon.php?return_path=/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aeri.20180150&etoc=1)." \*American Economic Review: Insights\*, 2 (1): 33-46.**

The authors estimate labor supply elasticities to MTurk employers of about 0.1. These low values are surprising in view of the seemingly low switching and search costs of on-demand labor markets. 

 作者估计劳动力供给对MTurk雇主的弹性约为0.1。考虑到**按需劳动力市场的低转换和搜索成本，这些低价值令人惊讶**。



**[Dube](https://www.nber.org/people/arindrajit_dube), Arindrajit, [Laura Giuliano](https://www.nber.org/people/laura_giuliano), and [Jonathan Leonard](https://www.nber.org/people/jonathan_leonard). [Fairness and Frictions: The Impact of Unequal Raises on Quit Behavior](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24906) NBER Working Paper No. 24906, August 2018.**

This paper analyzes how separations responded to arbitrary differences in own and peer wages at a large U.S. retailer. When raises are similar across peers within the workplace –this eliminating peer effects-- separations are quite insensitive to wages, suggesting that search frictions and monopsony are relevant in this low-wage sector.

 本文分析了在美国一家大型零售商中，员工离职是如何对自己和同事工资的任意差异做出反应的。当同事间的加薪幅度相似时(这消除了同事效应)，离职就对薪资相当不敏感，这表明在这个**低工资行业，搜索摩擦和垄断**是相关的。



**Training:**

**Garicano, Luis, and Luis Rayo. 2017. "[Relational Knowledge Transfers](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160194)." \*American Economic Review\*, 107 (9): 2695-2730.**

This theoretical paper shows that long apprenticeship periods with low pay can allow profit-maximizing firms to provide general-skills training to workers. The employer rationally delays the transfer of knowledge to prevent the apprentice from leaving before the employer has recouped its training costs. As a result, training periods are excessively long, relative to a world in which employers and workers can write binding training contracts. 

这篇理论论文表明，长时间低工资的学徒期可以使利润最大化的公司为工人提供通用技能培训。雇主合理地推迟知识的传授，以防止学徒在雇主收回培训成本之前离开。因此，**与雇主和工人可以签订有约束力的培训合同的当今世界相比，培训的时间过长**。





**John P. Papay, Eric S. Taylor, John H. Tyler and Mary E. Laski. “[Learning Job Skills from Colleagues at Work: Evidence from a Field Experiment Using Teacher Performance Data](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20170709)” \*American Economic Journal: Economic Policy\* 2020, 12(1): 359–388.** 

Asking teachers with high and low levels of a particular skill to work together on skill improvement improves student by 0.12 standard deviations in the low-skilled teachers’ classrooms. This field experiment shows that information exchange between workers is an important component of the job training process. 

 要求具有某一特定技能高低水平的教师共同努力提高技能，在低技能教师的课堂上提高学生0.12个标准差。现场试验表明，**工人之间的信息交流是职业培训过程的重要组成部分。**





# Tournaments

 

**Prize Structure:** 

**Joshua Graff Zivin and Elizabeth Lyons [The Effects of Prize Structures on Innovative Performance](http://papers.nber.org/papers/W26737?utm_campaign=ntwh&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ntwg22) NBER working paper no. 26737, February 2020.**  

When the object is to produce successful innovations, this field experiment in a large life sciences company shows that a winner-takes-all prize is more effective than the same amount of prize money shared across the ten best innovations. 

 **当目标是产生成功的创新时，在一家大型生命科学公司进行的现场实验表明，赢者通吃的奖金比10项最佳创新分享相同数量的奖金更有效。**

# Teams

 

**Battiston, Diego, Jordi Blanes i Vidal, and Thomas Kirchmaier, Thomas (2017) [Is distance dead? Face-to-face communication and productivity in teams](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/83603/1/dp1473.pdf)\*.\* CEP Discussion Papers, number 1473.** 

The Birmingham police department’s call response center eliminated face-to-face communication between handlers and dispatchers.  In contrast to the results from Bloom et al.’s (2015) CTrip study, Battiston et al. found that eliminating face-to-face interaction between workers substantially reduced productivity. The effect is stronger for urgent and complex tasks, and in high pressure conditions. 

伯明翰警察局的呼叫响应中心取消了处理人员和调度员之间的面对面交流。与Bloom等人(2015)的携程研究结果相反，Battiston等人发现，**消除员工之间的面对面交流大大降低了生产率。对于紧急、复杂的任务，以及高压条件下，效果更强**。
