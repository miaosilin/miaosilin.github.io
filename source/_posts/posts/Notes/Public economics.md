# Public economics focuses on two types of questions 
1. How do government policies affect the economy?
2. How should policies be designed to maximize welfare



 	1. Pratical relevance
          	a. Interest in improving econimic welfare: interest in pubilc economics
          	b. Almost every economic intervention occurs through  government policy (i.e. invloves  pubic economics) via two channels:
          		i. Price intervention: taxes, welfare, social insurance, public goods
          		ii. Regulation: min wages, FDA regulations(25% of products consumed), zoning, labor laws, min eduction laws, environment
          	c. Government directly employs on sixth of U.S. workforce
          	d. Stakes are extremely large because of broad scope of policies
          		i. Ex. Tax reforms immediately affect millions
          	e. Contentious debate on the appropriate role of government in society
          	f. Only one of these views can be correct
          		i. Injecting science into these debates has great practical value
     2. Academic interest
        a. Public economics is typically the end point for many other subfields
        b. Macro, development, labor, and corporate finance questions often ultimately motivated by a public economics question
        	i. Ex 1: macro studies on costs of business cyclts and intertemporal models of household behavior
        	ii. Ex 2: labor studies on employment effects of the minimum wage
        c. Natural to combine public finance with another field
        d. Understanding public finance can help ensure that you work on relevant topics 

3. Methodology
	a. At the frontier of a methodological transformation in applied microeconomics
	b. Data-driven approach to answering improtant policy questions.

4. First welfare theorem
	a. Private market provvides a pareto efficient outcome under three conditions
		i. No externalities
			1) Markets may be imcomplete due to lack of prices (e.g. pollution)
			2) This is why government funds public goods (highways, education, defense)
			3) Questions: what public goods to provide and how to correct externalities?
		ii. Perfect information
			1) Adverse selection in health insurance
				a) Mandated coverage could make everyone better off
			2) Capital markets (credit constraints) and subsides for education
			3) Markets for intergenerational goods
				a) Future generation's interests may not be fully reflected in market outcomes
		iii. Perfect competition
			1) When markets are not competitive, there is a role for government regulation
5. Individual failures
	a. If agents do not optimize, government intervention (e.g. by forcing saving via social security) may be disirable
	b. Conceptual challenge: how to avoid paternalism critique
		i. Why does govt. know better what's desirable for you ï¼ˆe.g. wearing a seatbelt, not smoking, saving more)
	c. Difficult but central issues
6. Redistributional concerns
	a. Even when the private market outcome is efficient, may not have good distributional properties
	b. Efficient markets generally seem to deliver very large rewards to small set of people (top incomes)
	c. Governmenr can redistribute income through tax and transfer system
